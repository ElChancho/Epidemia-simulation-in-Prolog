# EPIDEMIA SIMULATION #

This Prolog program simulates a simple epidemic infection.

## Load Program ##

To load the file, ensure that you are in the directory where the file is located and execute Prolog with the name of the file:

```prolog
prolog epidemia.pl
```

If you are already in the Prolog terminal:

```prolog
consult('epidemia.pl').
```

## Start the Program ##

To start the program, simply use:

```prolog
start.
```

**IMPORTANT!** Don't forget to include a final dot after your inserted data. This is how Prolog works.

- '100.' :heavy_check_mark:

- '100' :x:

Now, the program will prompt you for inputs (you can follow the recommendations if you prefer). 

After inserting the data, the program will display the chosen inputs, and it will provide information on the number of healthy, infected, and cured individuals every day.

Hope you enjoy this little project!
