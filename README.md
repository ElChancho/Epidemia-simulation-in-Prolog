# EPIDEMIA SIMULATION #

This program made in prolog, simulates a simple epidemia infection.

## Load program ##

To load the file, make sure that you are in the directory where the file is and execute prolog with the name of the file :

```
prolog epidemia.pl
```

If you are already in the prolog terminal :

```
consult('epidemia.pl')
```

## Start the program ##

To start the program, just use :

```
start.
```
**IMPORTANT!** Don't forget to write a final dot in your inserted data, this is because prolog works like this.

100 :x: 
<br></br>

100. :heavy_check_mark:

<br></br>
Now the program will ask you for some inputs (You can follow the recommendations if you want). 

After you inserted the data, the program will show the insertions that you just chosen and will show you how many people are healthy, infected and cured everyday.

Hope you like this little project!
